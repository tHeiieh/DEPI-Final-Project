Basic Network Setup:
Created the network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer.
Basic setting to all devices + ssh+ Standard ACL for ssh


Mohamed Hesham Mohamed:
VLAN Configuration:
Configured VLANs for each department (HR, Finance, IT, Guest) on all switches.
Assigned VLANs to interfaces on switches across both campuses.
Inter-VLAN Routing:
Set up routing between VLANs on core switches.
Assigned IP addresses to VLAN interfaces for inter-department communication.
DHCP Server Configuration:
Set up DHCP servers for automatic IP addressing.
Ensured redundancy between DHCP servers at both campuses.
